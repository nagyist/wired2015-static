    <h2>Lief's Story</h2>

    <p>“I don’t know if I can change peoples’ perceptions.  Some people come out of [jail] and they’ve had enough of prison life – and their only option is to change.  Then there are the ones who just want a handout.”</p>

    <p>Leif is definitely not looking for a handout.</p>

    <p>With plenty of security experience under his belt, Leif currently works as a security guard during our San Jose Weekly Success Team Meetings.  But he’s always looking for fulltime work.  Before it closed in 2011, Leif worked at the Central Valley Cannabis Club in Stockton.  He’s been on the San Jose Team since.</p>

    <p>His cool demeanor paired with a somewhat intimidating expression (except when his face widens into a big smile), make him the kind of security guard who automatically garners the utmost respect.  But given his criminal history, Leif is having a tough time finding a full-time security position.</p>

    <p>Leif understands that some people don’t change.  Some say they will, but they don’t and this doesn’t bode well for people like him who have changed.  “It takes awhile for [employers] to see my skills,” said Leif.</p>

    <p>Leif was raised to be a productive member of society, and he was young when he began to rebel.  “I was going through life – lackadaisical – not taking it too serious.  I was drinking and selling drugs,” he said.  “At that age I was going through something every human being does: trying to find your identity.  We all do things we wouldn’t normally do.”</p>

    <p>Then he adds, pointing at my notebook, “portray that gangster image however you like.”</p>

    <p>Then one day his identity searching caught up with him.  With the Three Strikes Rule in full force, suddenly Leif was facing 25 years to life. Fortunately, he was able to take 10 years, but by the time he left prison in 2003, he was 38 years old and a felon.</p>

    <p>“Now I’m taking life more seriously – but I dug myself into a hole,” said Leif.</p>

    <p>Despite his criminal record, he landed a job almost immediately with Metro PCS.  The guy who hired him wasn’t concerned with his criminal history.  “He just wanted someone to do a good job,” said Leif.</p>

    <p>Several years later, that job ended and Leif found himself joining our Palo Alto Team.  Three years later he was at the Cannabis Club.</p>

    <p>He did his job so well that visitors claimed the club had hired military personnel to stand outside its doors.  “Since I’m from the streets I can explain to people their options.  I just try to be polite and professional.  I have to practice compassion.”</p>

    <p>Leif is thankful for his position with Downtown Streets Team.  “I don’t know what I would do without this tool.  I would be headed down a negative road. Just having a job does a lot for self-esteem.  You need this stepping-stone for when you get that fulltime job because it helps you sharpen those skills you lost being out of the job market,” said Leif.</p>

    <p>“Streets Team is definitely a blessing, a life preserver; it’s just a big help by keeping a person from becoming really desperate,” he said.</p>

    <p>He can’t help smiling at this point and adds, looking at me, “Now you’ve cracked my demeanor.”  Immediately he becomes straight-faced and goes back to doing what he loves, security for Downtown Streets Team.</p>
