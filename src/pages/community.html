      <h3>History</h3>

      <p>Downtown Streets Team was founded in 2005 by the Palo Alto Business Improvement District as the solution to the two major concerns that were plaguing the downtown area: panhandling and trash accumulation. Once the issues were identified, a work-first model was developed, in which the unhoused men and women in the community can volunteer up to 20 hours per week in exchange for case management and employment services. Thus, Downtown Streets Team was born.</p>

      <p>Our Palo Alto Team operates in downtown Palo Alto 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. The team reaches out to the homeless living in our focus areas along with carrying out a variety of jobs, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Security and cleaning of parking garages</li>
        <li>Cleaning and lining soccer fields</li>
        <li>Sweeping downtown streets</li>
        <li>Peer-to-peer outreach</li>
      </ul>
